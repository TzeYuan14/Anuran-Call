# Anuran-Call

Anuran is any of the vertebrates of the order Anura, characterized by the
absence of a tail and very long hind legs specialized for hopping: class
Amphibia (amphibians), which is commonly known as the frogs and toads.
Recently, recognition of anuran species through their calls has received a
lot of attention because of its potential applicability in ecological studies.

However, most of the recorded anuran species are considered to be
monotypic based on various research presented. Hence, the classification
of numerous anuran species would be a challenge for researchers.

Therefore, this project aims to develop an interpretable and trustworthy predictive model that can
classify various anuran species accurately and effectively. We have used the given dataset about the Anuran species, to
create four predictive models including: 
- k-nearest neighbours 
- decision tree 
- support vector machine
- neural network

##### to test and predict based on the dataset.
